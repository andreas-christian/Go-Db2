## Accessing Db2 with the Go programming language

The sample programs in this repository show you how to a access Db2 databases using the Go programming language. Go was designed at Google to improve programming productivity. 

Read through the following tutorial to understand how the sample programs select data from Db2 and how they insert, update and delete data. 

If you just want to get some hands-on programming experience with Go language and Db2 you also find the below tutorial on a virtual machine in the cloud. This has all required software pre-installed and can be used for up to one week: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/dte/tutorial/go-db2-use-go-language-develop-db2-database-applications

Here are the prerequisites to run the sample programs on your local machine:
Install a go language binary release suitable for your system: https://golang.org/
Install Db2. The Db2 Community Edition is available as standard download or as a docker container which can be installed with a single command: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-db2-developer-community-edition
